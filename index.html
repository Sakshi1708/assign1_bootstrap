            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p><div>Started in 2010, Ristorante con Fusion quickly established itself as a culinary icon par 
                excellence in Hong Kong. With its unique brand of world fusion cuisine that can be found 
                nowhere else, it enjoys patronage from the A-list clientele in Hong Kong. Featuring four of
                the best three-star Michelin chefs in the world, you never know what will arrive on your 
                plate the next time you visit us.
                </div>
                <div>The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to <i>The Frying Pan</i>, a successful chain
                    started by our CEO, Mr. Peter Pan, that featured for the first time the world's best 
                    cuisines in a pan.

                <h3>Peter Pan Chief <small>Epicurious Officer</small></h3>
                <p><div>Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant parents who undertook the 
                    arduous journey to the shores of America with the intention of giving their children the best
                     future. His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with whatever is 
                    available inexpensively at the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines
                     for which <i>The Frying Pan</i> became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion cuisines to this restaurant,
                      pioneering cross-cultural culinary connections

                <div>Our CFO, Danny, as he is affectionately referred to by his colleagues, comes from a long established
                     family tradition in farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm in the Australian outback
                      gave him great appreciation for varieties of food sources. As he puts it in his own words,<i> Everything 
                      that runs, wins, and everything that stays, pays!</i>

                <h3>Agumbe Tang <small>Chief Taste Officer</small></h3>
                <div>Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our CTO, personally ensures that every dish
                     that we serve meets his exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that ensues if their dish
                      does not meet his exacting standards. He lives by his motto, <i>You click only if you survive my lick.</i>
