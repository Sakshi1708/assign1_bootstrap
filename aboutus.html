            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p><div>Started in 2010, Ristorante con Fusion quickly established itself as a culinary icon par 
                excellence in Hong Kong. With its unique brand of world fusion cuisine that can be found 
                nowhere else, it enjoys patronage from the A-list clientele in Hong Kong. Featuring four of
                the best three-star Michelin chefs in the world, you never know what will arrive on your 
                plate the next time you visit us.
                </div>
                <div>The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to <i>The Frying Pan</i>, a successful chain
                    started by our CEO, Mr. Peter Pan, that featured for the first time the world's best 
                    cuisines in a pan.

                    arduous journey to the shores of America with the intention of giving their children the best
                    future. His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with whatever is 
                    available inexpensively at the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines
                    for which <i>The Frying Pan</i> became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion cuisines to this restaurant,
